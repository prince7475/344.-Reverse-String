Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

- Pointers
- left = 0 // starting idx
- right = arr.length - 1 // end index
while(left < right){
  swap(left, right, arr)
  left++
  right--
}

return arr

function reverseString(arr){
  let left = 0
  let right = arr.length - 1
  while(left < right){
    swap(left, right, arr)
    left++
    right--
  }
  
  return arr
}

function swap(i,j,arr){
  let temp = arr[i]
  arr[i] = arr[j]
  arr[j] = temp
}
